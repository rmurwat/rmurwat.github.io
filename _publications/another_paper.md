The impact of aerosols on cloud liquid water path (LWP) is uncertain, in part due to the difficulties in establishing causality between changes in aerosol or droplet number concentration (Nd) and subsequent changes in LWP. Here, we used sequential satellite observations are used to examine the influence of Nd on LWP variations. It is found that while there is an overall decrease in LWP with increasing Nd, various factors such as aerosol production and environmental conditions complicate the Nd-LWP relationship. By considering the temporal development of clouds, a weaker negative relationship is observed globally, highlighting the need for more frequent observations to better understand these complex interactions.
