I participated the British Antarctic Survey's An Introduction to Polar Fieldwork for Early Career Researchers course in 2023. This course, which took us to Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic, was designed to provide early career researchers with the skills and knowledge required to plan and undertake fieldwork in polar regions. We learned invaluable teamworking, fieldwork, and survival skills needed to work in such a challenging environment.
